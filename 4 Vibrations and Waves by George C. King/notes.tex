\section{Simple Harmonic Motion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is \[\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = -\omega^2 x\] where \[\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}\]

  \item The general solution of the equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is \[x = A \cos (\omega t + \phi)\] or equivalently \[x = a \cos \omega t + b \sin \omega t\]

  \item The angular frequency $\omega$ is determined entirely by properties of the oscillator, e.g. its mass and spring coefficient

  \item The total energy of a harmonic oscillator is \[E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2\]

  \item Nearly all potential wells have a shape that is parabolic when sufficiently close to the equilibrium position, so most oscillating systems will oscillate with SHM when the amplitude of oscillation is small

  \item The vibrations of nuclei in a molecule can be modeled by SHM, but only a discrete set of vibrational energies is possible, namely \[\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega, \, \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega, \, \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega, \, \ldots\] where $\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by $2 \pi$

  \item The total energy of a system undergoing SHM is always given by an expression of the form \[E = \frac{1}{2} \alpha v^2 + \frac{1}{2} \beta x^2\] where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are physical constants — if we obtain this equation during the analysis of a system we know we have SHM

  \item The equation of motion for a system described by the energy equation above is \[\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = -\frac{\beta}{\alpha} x\]
\end{itemize}

\section{The Damped Harmonic Oscillator}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator is

        \begin{align*}
          F = m a                                                     & = -k x - b v \\
          m \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + b \frac{d x}{d t} + k x             & = 0          \\
          \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + \gamma \frac{d x}{d t} + \omega_0^2 x & = 0
        \end{align*}

        where $\gamma = b / m$ and $\omega_0^2 = k / m$

  \item $\omega_0$ is known as the \textbf{natural frequency of oscillation}, i.e. the oscillation frequency if there were no damping

  \item \textbf{Light damping / underdamped}

        \begin{itemize}
          \item The motion is still oscillatory but the amplitude decreases expontentially

          \item This occurs when $\gamma^2 / 4 < \omega_0^2$

          \item The general solution is \[x = A_0 e^{-\gamma t / 2} \cos (\omega t + \phi)\] where $A_0$ is the initial amplitude

          \item Successive maxima decrease by the same fractional amount \[\frac{A_n}{A_{n + 1}} = e^{\gamma T / 2}\]

          \item The natural logarithm of $A_n / A_{n + 1}$ is called the \textbf{logarithmic decrement} \[\ln \left( \frac{A_n}{A_{n + 1}} \right) = \frac{\gamma T}{2}\]
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Heavy damping / overdamped}

        \begin{itemize}
          \item The motion is not oscillatory and returns sluggishly to the equilibrium position

          \item This occurs when $\gamma^2 / 4 > \omega_0^2$

          \item The general solution is

                \begin{align*}
                  x & = e^{-\gamma t / 2} [A e^{\alpha t} + B e^{-\alpha t}]           \\
                    & = A e^{(\alpha - \gamma / 2) t} + B e^{-(\alpha + \gamma / 2) t}
                \end{align*}

                where $\alpha = \sqrt{\gamma^2 / 4 - \omega_0^2}$
        \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Critical damping}

        \begin{itemize}
          \item The motion is not oscillatory and returns as quickly as possible to the equilibrium position

          \item This occurs when $\gamma^2 / 4 = \omega_0^2$

          \item The general solution is \[x = A e^{-\gamma t / 2} + B t e^{-\gamma t / 2}\]
        \end{itemize}

  \item The total energy of an underdamped system decreases over time \[E = E_0 e^{-\gamma t}\] where $E_0$ is the initial energy of the system

  \item The \textbf{decay time} or \textbf{time constant} of the system $\tau = 1 / \gamma$ is the time it takes for its energy to decrease by a factor of $e$

  \item The \textbf{quality factor} of a harmonic oscillator is a dimensionless value that gives a measure of the degree of damping \[Q = \frac{\omega_0}{\gamma}\] where large values indicate little damping and small values indicate more damping

\item The quality factor can also be used as a measure of fraction of energy lost (i.e. $\Delta E / E$) per cycle $2 \pi / Q$ or per radian $1 / Q$
\end{itemize}

\section{Forced Oscillations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The equation of motion for an undamped forced harmonic oscillator is \[m \frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + k x = F_0 \cos \omega t\] the general solution of which is \[x = A(\omega) \cos (\omega t - \delta)\] where \[A(\omega) = \frac{F_0}{k (1 - \omega^2 / \omega_0^2)} \text{ and } \delta = 0\] for $\omega < \omega_0$ and \[A(\omega) = -\frac{F_0}{k (1 - \omega^2 / \omega_0^2)} \text{ and } \delta = \pi\] for $\omega > \omega_0$

  \item From the above it can be seen that:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow F_0 / k$ as $\omega \rightarrow 0$

          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow \infty$ as $\omega \rightarrow \omega_0$

          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow 0$ as $\omega \rightarrow \infty$
        \end{itemize}

  \item The equation of motion for a damped forced harmonic oscillator is \[\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + \gamma \frac{d x}{d t} + \omega_0^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos \omega t\] where $\gamma = b / m$ and $\omega_0^2 = k / m$ the general solution of which is \[x = A(\omega) \cos (\omega t - \delta)\] where \[A(\omega) = \frac{F_0}{m [(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + \omega^2 \gamma^2]^{1 / 2}}\] and \[\delta = \arctan \frac{\omega \gamma}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\]

  \item From the above it can be seen that:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow F_0 / k$ as $\omega \rightarrow 0$

          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow F_0 \omega_0 / k \gamma$ as $\omega \rightarrow \omega_0$

          \item $A(\omega) \rightarrow 0$ as $\omega \rightarrow \infty$
        \end{itemize}

  \item $A(\omega)$ is maximised when its denominator is minimised, leading to \[\omega_\text{max} = \omega_0 (1 - \gamma^2 / 2 \omega_0^2)^{1 / 2}\] and thus \[A_\text{max} = \frac{F_0 \omega_0 / \gamma}{k (1 - \gamma^2 / 4 \omega_0^2)^{1 / 2}}\]

  \item The power absorbed by a damped oscillator to sustain its motion is exactly equal to the rate at which the energy is dissipated, i.e.

        \begin{align*}
          P(t) & = b v(t) \times v(t)                      \\
               & = b [v(t)]^2                              \\
               & = v [v_0(t)]^2 \sin^2 (\omega t - \delta)
        \end{align*}

  \item The average power absorbed over one cycle is \[\overline{P}(\omega) = \frac{b[v_0(\omega)]^2}{2} = \frac{\omega^2 F_0^2 \gamma}{2 m [(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + \omega^2 \gamma^2]}\]

  \item From the above it can be seen that:

        \begin{itemize}
          \item $\overline{P}(\omega) \rightarrow 0$ as $\omega \rightarrow 0$

          \item $\overline{P}(\omega) \rightarrow F_0^2 / 2 m \gamma$ as $\omega \rightarrow \omega_0$

          \item $\overline{P}(\omega) \rightarrow 0$ as $\omega \rightarrow \infty$
        \end{itemize}

  \item The \textbf{power resonance curve} of an oscillating system graphs the average power absorbed by the system over a cycle to the driving frequency

  \item The \textbf{full width at half height} of a power resonance curve is the width of the curve at height $P_\text{max} / 2$, is a measure of the sharpness of the system's response to an applied force, and is equal to $\omega_\text{fwhh} = \gamma = \omega_0 / Q$

  \item From the above it can be seen that \[Q = \frac{\omega_0}{\gamma} = \frac{\omega_0}{\omega_\text{fwhh}}\]

  \item A resonance circuit can be used to amplify AC signals around a particular frequency by the $Q$-factor of the circuit — this makes them useful in radio receivers to tune a specific frequency

  \item When a driving force is first applied to a system, the system will be inclined to oscillate at its natural frequency $\omega_0$. The behaviour of the system is described by the sum of two oscillations, one at frequency $\omega_0$ and the other at $\omega$. Eventually the $\omega_0$ oscillations die out leaving the system in its \textbf{steady state} condition. The initial behaviour is reffered to as its \textbf{transient response}.

  \item The equation of motion for damped forced oscillations is the second-order nonhomogeneous linear differential equation \[\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + \gamma \frac{d x}{d t} + \omega_0^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos \omega t.\] The oscillations at frequency $\omega_0$ present only during the transient response are described by the complementary function of this equation, i.e. a fundamental set of solutions of the associated homogeneous differential equation, and the oscillations at frequency $\omega$ are described by a particular solution of this equation.

  \item If $z = x + y i$, the \textbf{complex conjugate} of $z$ is $z^* = x - y i$

  \item The product of a complex number with its conjugate is $z z^* = z^2 + y^2$

  \item The \textbf{modulus} of a complex number is defined as $|z| = \sqrt{z z^*} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

  \item Division of complex numbers can be performed like so \[\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{z_1 z_2^*}{z_2 z_2^*} = \frac{(x_1 + i y_1) (x_2 - i y_2)}{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \frac{(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2) + i (x_2 y_1 - x_1 y_2)}{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\]

  \item An \textbf{Argand diagram} is two-dimensional graph where the $x$-axis is used as the real axis and the $y$-axis is used as the imaginary axis

  \item Using \textbf{Euler's formula} \[e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x\] a complex number can be represented as \[z = x + i y = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = z e^{i \theta}\] where $r$ is the modulus $|z|$ and $\theta$ is the angle of $z$ from the positive $x$-axis known as its \textbf{argument}

  \item Multiplication of complex numbers is equivalent to rotation and scaling in the complex plane \[r_1 e^{i \theta} \times r_2 e^{i \phi} = r_1 r_2 e^{i (\theta + \phi)}\]

  \item Phasor diagrams can be represented on the complex plane with phasors as complex numbers $z = A e^{i (\omega t + \phi)}$ and their projection onto the $x$-axis as their real components

  \item Differentiation with respect to time of a complex phasor is equivalent to multiplication by $i \omega$
\end{itemize}
