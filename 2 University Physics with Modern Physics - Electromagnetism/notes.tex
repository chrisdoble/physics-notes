\section{Electric Charge and Electric Field}

\subsection{Electric Charge}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electrons have a much smaller mass than neutrons and protons

  \item Neutrons and protons have a very similar mass

  \item Electrons and protons have the same magnitude of charge

  \item The number of protons in an atom determins its \textbf{atomic number}

  \item If an electron is added to a neutral atom it becomes a \textbf{negative ion}, if one is removed it becomes a \textbf{positive ion} — this is called \textbf{ionisation}

  \item The \textbf{principle of conservation of charge} states that the algebraic sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is constant

  \item The electron or proton's magnitude of charge is a natural unit of charge — every observable amount of electric charge is an integer multiple of this
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conductors, Insulators, and Incuded Charges}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Conductors} pemit easy movement of charge, \textbf{insulators} do not

  \item Holding a charged object near an uncharged object causes free electrons in the latter to move away/towards the former, resulting in a net charge on either side — this is called \textbf{induced charge}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coulomb's Law}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The SI unit of charge is called one \textbf{coulomb} (1 C) and is defined such that $1.602176634\times10^{-19}$ C is equal to the charge of an electron or proton

  \item \textbf{Coulomb's law} describes the electric force between two point charges \[F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}\] where the \textbf{electric constant} $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}\,\textrm{C}^2/\textrm{N}\cdot \textrm{m}^2$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the charges, and $r$ is the distance between them

  \item The electric force is always directed along the line between the two charges, attracting opposite charges and repelling like charges

  \item $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$ can be approximated as $9.0 \times 10^9\,\textrm{N}\cdot\textrm{m}^2/\textrm{C}^2$

  \item The principle of superposition of forces also applies to electric charges
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electric Field and Electric Forces}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The electric force on a charged object is exerted by the electric field created by other charged objects

  \item We can determine if there is an electric field at a point by placing a test charge $q_0$ there and seeing if it experiences an electric force — the electric field at that point (the electric force per unit charge) is then given by \[\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q_0}\]

  \item Rearranging, the force experienced by a charge $q_0$ at a point is given by \[\mathbf{F} = q_0\mathbf{E}\]

  \item When considering an electric field produced by a point charge, the location of the point charge is called the \textbf{source point} and the location at which we're trying to determine the field is called the \textbf{field point}

  \item The electric field produced by a point charge is given by \[\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}\] where $q$ is the charge of the point charge, $r$ is the distance between the source and field points, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector from the source to the field point

  \item Unlike Coulomb's law this equation doesn't use the absolute value of $q$ meaning that the electric fields of positive charges point away from the charge, while those of negative charges point towards them

  \item In electrostatics, the electric field inside the material of a conductor (but not holes within the material) is $\mathbf{0}$
\end{itemize}
