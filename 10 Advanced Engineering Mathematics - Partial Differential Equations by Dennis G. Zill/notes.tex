\section{Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series}

\subsection{Orthogonal Functions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{inner product} of two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ on an interval $[a, b]$ is the number \[(f_1, f_2) = \int_a^b f_1(x) f_2(x) \,d x.\]

  \item Two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are said to be orthogonal on an interval if $(f_1, f_2) = 0$.

  \item A set of real-valued functions $\{\phi_1(x), \phi_2(x), \ldots, \phi_n(x)\}$ is said to be \textbf{orthogonal} on an interval if \[(\phi_i, \phi_j) = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j.\]

  \item The \textbf{square norm} of a function is \[||\phi_n(x)||^2 = (\phi_n, \phi_n)\] and thus its \textbf{norm} is \[||\phi_n(x)|| = \sqrt{(\phi_n, \phi_n)}.\]

  \item An \textbf{orthonormal set} of functions is an orthogonal set of functions that all have a norm of $1$.

  \item An orthogonal set can be made into an orthonormal set by dividing each member by its norm.

  \item If $\{\phi_n(x)\}$ is an infinite orthogonal set of functions on an interval $[a, b]$ and $f(x)$ is an arbitrary function, then it's possible to determine a set of coefficients $c_n, n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ such that \[f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n \phi_n(x) = c_0 \phi_0(x) + c_1 \phi_1(x) + \ldots + c_n \phi_n(x) + \ldots\] This is called an \textbf{orthogonal series expansion} of $f$ or a \textbf{generalized Fourier series} where the coefficients are given by \[c_n = \frac{(f, \phi_n)}{||\phi_n||^2}.\]

  \item A set of real-valued functions $\{\phi_n(x)\}$ is said to be \textbf{orthogonal with respect to a weight function} $w(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$ if \[\int_a^b w(x) \phi_m(x) \phi_n(x) \,d x = 0,\ m \ne n.\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fourier Series}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Fourier series} of a function $f$ defined on the interval $(-p, p)$ is given by \[f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( a_n \cos \frac{n \pi}{p} x + b_n \sin \frac{n \pi}{p} x \right)\] where \begin{align*}
          a_0 & = \frac{1}{p} \int_{-p}^p f(x) \,d x                        \\
          a_n & = \frac{1}{p} \int_{-p}^p f(x) \cos \frac{n \pi}{p} x \,d x \\
          b_n & = \frac{1}{p} \int_{-p}^p f(x) \sin \frac{n \pi}{p} x \,d x
        \end{align*}

  \item At points of discontinuity in $f$, the Fourier series takes on the average of the values either side of it.

  \item The Fourier series of a function $f$ gives a \textbf{periodic extension} of the function outside the interval $(-p, p)$.
\end{itemize}
