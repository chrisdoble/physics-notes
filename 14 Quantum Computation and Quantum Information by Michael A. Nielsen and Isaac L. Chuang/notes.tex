\subsection{Quantum bits}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The special states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ form an orthonormal basis and are known as \textbf{computational basis states}.

  \item A quantum bit (\textbf{qubit}) is a linear combination of the computational basis states \[\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}\] where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers.

  \item When we measure a qubit we either get $\ket{0}$ with probability $|\alpha|^2$ or $\ket{1}$ with probability $|\beta|^2$. Thus, $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ and a qubit can be thought of as a unit vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space.

  \item If a qubit is in the state \[\ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{1})\] there's a 50/50 chance of measuring $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$.

  \item If we let \[\alpha = e^{i \gamma} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\] and \[\beta = e^{i \gamma} e^{i \varphi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2}\] then \begin{align*}
          |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 & = \alpha^* \alpha + \beta^* \beta                   \\
                                 & = \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \\
                                 & = 1
        \end{align*} so the qubit is still normalised and it can be written \[\ket{\psi} = e^{i \gamma} \left( \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \ket{0} + e^{i \varphi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \ket{1} \right).\] It turns out that $e^{i \gamma}$ has no observable effects and we can effectively write \[\ket{\psi} = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \ket{0} + e^{i \varphi} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \ket{1}.\] This defines a point on a three-dimensional sphere known as the \textbf{Bloch sphere} where $\theta$ and $\varphi$ take on their usual roles in a spherical coordinate system.

  \item Before measurement a qubit is in a linear combination of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ but when measured you get one or the other and the state of the system changes to match the measured result.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multiple Bits}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A two qubit system has four computational basis state $\ket{00}$, $\ket{01}$, $\ket{10}$, and $\ket{11}$ so the general expression for the state of such a system is \[\ket{\psi} = \alpha_{00} \ket{00} + \alpha_{01} \ket{01} + \alpha_{10} \ket{10} + \alpha_{11} \ket{11}.\]

  \item If you were to measure the first qubit, you would get $\ket{0}$ with probability $|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2$ and the system would be left in the state \[\ket{\psi} = \frac{\alpha_{00} \ket{00} + \alpha_{01} \ket{01}}{\sqrt{|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2}},\] i.e. it is renormalised such that the normalisation condition still holds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Computation}

\subsubsection{Single Qubit Gates}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The quantum \textsc{not} changes $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$ and $\ket{1}$ to $\ket{0}$. It acts linearly on superpositions of those states, i.e. it turns $\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$ into $\beta \ket{0} + \alpha \ket{1}$. If a quantum state $\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$ is written in vector notation as \[\ket{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix}
            \alpha \\
            \beta
          \end{bmatrix}\] then the quantum \textsc{not} gate can be expressed in matrix form as \[X = \begin{bmatrix}
            0 & 1 \\
            1 & 0
          \end{bmatrix}.\]

  \item In order to preserve the normalisation condition, matrix representations of quantum gates must be unitary, i.e. $M^\dagger M = I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix.

  \item An arbitrary unitary 2x2 matrix can be decomposed into a finite set of other 2x2 matrices. This means an arbitrary single qubit gate can be generated by a finite set of other gates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multiple Qubit Gates}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The controlled-\textsc{not} or \textsc{cnot} gate is a multi-qubit gate that has two input qubits known as the control qubit and the target qubit. If the control qubit is set to $\ket{0}$ the target qubit is left alone, but if it's set to $\ket{1}$ the target qubit is flipped. Another way of writing this is $\ket{A, B} \rightarrow \ket{A, A \oplus B}$ where $\oplus$ is modulo-two addition. Yet another way of writing this is in matrix form \[U_{CN} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 0
          \end{bmatrix}\] where the first column describes what happens to the $\ket{00}$ basis state, etc.

  \item Other classical gates like \textsc{nand} or \textsc{xor} can't be represented as quantum gates as they're irreversibile. For example, given the output $A \oplus B$ from an \textsc{xor} gate it's not possible to determine what the inputs $A$ and $B$ were.

  \item Any multiple qubit logic gate may be composed from \textsc{cnot} and single qubit gates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measurements in bases other than the computational basis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Given any basis states $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$ it is possible to express an arbitrary state as a linear combination $\alpha \ket{a} + \beta \ket{b}$ of those states. For example, if $\ket{a} = \ket{+} = (\ket{0} + \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{b} = \ket{-} = (\ket{0} - \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$ then \[\ket{\phi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1} = \alpha \frac{\ket{+} + \ket{-}}{\sqrt{2}} + \beta \frac{\ket{0} - \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\alpha + \beta}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{+} + \frac{\alpha - \beta}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{-}.\]

  \item If $\ket{a}$ and $\ket{b}$ are orthonormal, it's also possible to perform a measurement with respect to that basis. In the example above you would measure $\ket{+}$ with probability $|\alpha + \beta|^2 / 2$ and $\ket{-}$ with probability $|\alpha - \beta|^2 / 2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quantum circuits}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Applying a \textsc{cnot} gate three times swaps the state of two qubits: \begin{align*}
          \ket{a, b} & \rightarrow \ket{a, a \oplus b}                                           \\
                     & \rightarrow \ket{a \oplus (a \oplus b), a \oplus b} = \ket{b, a \oplus b} \\
                     & \rightarrow \ket{b, (a \oplus b) \oplus b} = \ket{b, a}.
        \end{align*} This can be represented in a quantum circuit diagram \[\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=.7em {
          & \ctrl{1} & \targ & \ctrl{1} & \qw \\
          & \targ & \ctrl{-1} & \targ & \qw
          }\] which is equivalent to \[\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=1.5em {
          & \qswap & \qw \\
          & \qswap \qwx & \qw
          }\]

  \item Quantum circuits don't allow loops (they are acyclic), they don't allow multiple wires to be joined into one, and they don't allow one wire to be split into multiple wires.

  \item If $U$ is a unitary matrix operating on $n$ qubits then $U$ can be regarded as a quantum gate. Then we can define a controlled-$U$ gate which takes a single control qubit and $n$ target qubits. If the control qubit is set to $0$ then nothing happens to the target qubits. If it's set to 1 then the $U$ gate is applied to the target qubits. \[\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=.7em {
          & \ctrl{1} & \qw \\
          & \multigate{2}{U} & \qw \\
          & \ghost{U} & \qw \\
          & \ghost{U} & \qw
          }\]

  \item Measurement is represented as \[\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=.7em {
          \lstick{\ket{\psi}} & \meter & \cw
          }\] where the double lines represent a classical bit.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Qubit copying circuit?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textsc{cnot} gate can be used to copy a classical bit. As input it takes a bit in state $x$ and a ``scratchpad'' bit set to zero. The output is a bit in state $x$ and a bit in state $0$ if $x = 0$ and $1$ if $x = 1$ â€” both bits are in state $x$.

  \item However, a \textsc{cnot} gate cannot be used to copy quantum information. As input it takes a qubit in the state $\ket{\psi} = a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}$ and a ``scratchpad'' qubit set to $\ket{0}$. The input state may be written as \[[a \ket{0} + b \ket{1}] \ket{0} = a \ket{0 0} + b \ket{0 1}.\] The gate negates the second bit if the first bit is $1$ so the output is $a \ket{0 0} + b \ket{1 1}$. The desired output is \[\ket{\psi} \ket{\psi} = a^2 \ket{0 0} + a b \ket{0 1} + a b \ket{1 0} + b^2 \ket{1 1}.\] Unless $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, i.e. it's a classical bit, the qubit hasn't been copied. This is known as the \textbf{no-cloning theorem}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example: Bell states}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The Hadamard gate acts on a single qubit, mapping $\ket{0}$ to $(\ket{0} + \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{1}$ to $(\ket{0} - \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$.

  \item This circuit \[\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=.7em {
          & \gate{H} & \ctrl{1} & \qw \\
          & \qw & \targ & \qw
          }\] applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit which then acts as the control input to the \textsc{cnot}. The output states \begin{align*}
          \ket{\beta_{00}} & = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}},             \\
          \ket{\beta_{01}} & = \frac{\ket{01} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}},             \\
          \ket{\beta_{10}} & = \frac{\ket{00} - \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}, \text{ and} \\
          \ket{\beta_{11}} & = \frac{\ket{01} - \ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}}              \\
        \end{align*} are known as the \textbf{Bell states}, \textbf{EPR states}, or \textbf{EPR pairs}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example: quantum teleportation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If Alice and Bob prepare a Bell pair, Alice takes the first qubit, and Bob takes the second qubit, it's possible to teleport an arbitrary qubit from Alice to Bob at a later time by communicating only classical information.

  \item This doesn't enable faster-than-light communication because Alice still needs to communicate classical information to Bob which is limited by the speed of light. Bob then uses this information to conditionally apply further gates to his qubit to get it into the teleported state.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum algorithms}

\subsubsection{Classical computations on a quantum computer}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Classical circuits may contain irreversible operations, e.g. \textsc{nand} gates, but quantum circuits must be reversible. In order to simulate classical circuits on a quantum computer we must find a way to make these irreversible operations reversible.

  \item Any classical circuit can be replaced by an equivalent classical circuit containing only reversible elements by making use of the \textbf{Toffoli gate}. This gate has three input bits and three output bits. Two bits are control bits and are unaffected by the gate. The third bit is a target bit that is flipped if both of the control bits are $1$ and is otherwise left alone. Applying the Toffoli gate twice has the effect $(a, b, c) \rightarrow (a, b, c \oplus a b) \rightarrow (a, b, c)$ and thus the gate is reversible.

  \item The Toffoli gate can also be used to simulate \textsc{nand} gates and to do \textsc{fanout}. With this it is possible to make any classical circuit reversible.

  \item The equivalent quantum Toffoli gate works as expected, e.g. it changes $\ket{1 1 0}$ to $\ket{1 1 1}$. This ensures quantum computers are capable of performing any classical computation.

  \item If the classical computer is non-deterministic, i.e. it can generate random numbers, this can be simulated on a quantum computer by preparing a qubit in the state $\ket{0}$, sending it through a Hadamard gate to produce $(\ket{0} + \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$, and then measuring the state. The result will be $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ with 50/50 probability.
\end{itemize}
