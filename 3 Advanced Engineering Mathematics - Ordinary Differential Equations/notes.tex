\section{Introduction to Differential Equations}

\subsection{Definitions and Terminology}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An equation containing the derivatives of one or more dependent variables, with respect to one or more independent variables, is said to be a \textbf{differential equation}

  \item An \textbf{ordinary differential equation} (ODE) is a differential equation that contains only ordinary (i.e. non-partial) derivatives of one or more functions with respect to a single independent variable

  \item A \textbf{partial differential equation} is a differential equation that contains only partial derivatives of one or more functions of two or more independent variables

  \item The \textbf{order} of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation

  \item First order ODEs are sometimes written in the \textbf{differential form} \[M(x, y) \,dx + N(x, y) \,dy = 0\]

  \item $n$-th order ODEs in one dependent variable can be expressed by the \textbf{general form} \[F(x, y, y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0\]

  \item It's possible to solve ODEs in the general form uniquely for the highest derivative $y^{(n)}$ in terms of the other $n + 1$ variables, allowing them to be expressed in the \textbf{normal form} \[\frac{d^n y}{d x^n} = f(x, y, y', \ldots, y^{(n - 1)})\]

  \item An $n$-th order ODE is said be \textbf{linear} in the variable $y$ if it can be expressed in the form \[a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n - 1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y - g(x) = 0\] i.e. the dependent variable $y$ and all of its derivatives aren't raised to a power or used in nonlinear functions like $e^y$ or $\sin y$, and the coefficients $a_0$, $a_1$, $\ldots$, $a_n$ depend at most on the independent variable $x$

  \item A \textbf{nonlinear} ODE is one that is not linear

  \item A \textbf{solution} to an ODE is a function $\phi$, defined on an interval $I$ and possessing at least $n$ derivatives that are continuous on $I$, such that \[F(x, \phi(x), \phi'(x), \ldots, \phi^{n}(x)) = 0 \text{ for all } x \text{ in } I.\]

  \item The \textbf{interval of definition}, \textbf{interval of validity}, or the \textbf{domain} of a solution is the interval over which the solution is valid

  \item A solution of a differential equation that is $0$ on an interval $I$ is said to be a \textbf{trivial solution}

  \item Because solutions to differential equations must be differentiable over their interval of validity, discontinuities, etc. must be excluded from the interval

  \item An \textbf{explicit solution} to an ODE is one where the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants

  \item An \textbf{implicit solution} to an ODE is a relation $G(x, y) = 0$ over an interval $I$ provided there exists at least one function $\phi$ that satisfies the relation as well as the ODE on $I$

  \item When solving a first-order ODE we usually obtain a solution containing a single arbitrary constant or parameter $c$. A solution containing an arbitrary constant represents a set of solution called a \textbf{one-parameter family of solutions}

  \item When solving an $n$-th order differential equation we usually obtain an \textbf{$n$-parameter family of solutions}

  \item A solution of a differential equation that is free from arbitrary parameters is called a \textbf{particular solution}

  \item A \textbf{singular solution} is a solution to a differential equation that isn't a member of a family of solutions

  \item A \textbf{system of ODEs} is two or more equations involving the derivatives of two or more unknown functions of a single independent variable. A solution of such a system is a differentiable function for each equation defined on a common interval $I$ that satisfy each equation of the system on that interval
