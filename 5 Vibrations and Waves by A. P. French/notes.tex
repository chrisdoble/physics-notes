\section{Periodic motions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fouriers theorem states that any repeating signal of period $T$ can be expressed as a sum of $\sin$ waves with periods $T$, $T / 2$, etc.

  \item It's important to define the domain of a SHM equation, e.g. for what values of $t$ is the motion defined?

  \item SHM can be considered a projection of uniform circular motion

  \item That uniform circular motion can be represented by a number in the complex plane, with the projection being its real part

  \item Multiplication by $j$ can be considered a counter-clockwise rotation of $\ang{90}$ in the complex plane

  \item Euler's formula states \[e^{j \theta} = \cos \theta + j \sin \theta\]

  \item Multiplication of a complex number $z$ by $e^{j \theta}$ is equivalent to a counter-clockwise rotation of $z$ by an angle of $\theta$
\end{itemize}
