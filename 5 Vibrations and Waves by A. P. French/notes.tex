\section{Periodic motions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fouriers theorem states that any repeating signal of period $T$ can be expressed as a sum of $\sin$ waves with periods $T$, $T / 2$, etc.

  \item It's important to define the domain of a SHM equation, e.g. for what values of $t$ is the motion defined?

  \item SHM can be considered a projection of uniform circular motion

  \item That uniform circular motion can be represented by a number in the complex plane, with the projection being its real part

  \item Multiplication by $j$ can be considered a counter-clockwise rotation of $\ang{90}$ in the complex plane

  \item Euler's formula states \[e^{j \theta} = \cos \theta + j \sin \theta\]

  \item Multiplication of a complex number $z$ by $e^{j \theta}$ is equivalent to a counter-clockwise rotation of $z$ by an angle of $\theta$
\end{itemize}

\section{The superposition of periodic motions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The combination of two SHM's of the same period

        \[x_1 = A_1 \cos (\omega t + \alpha_1)\]
        \[x_2 = A_2 \cos (\omega t + \alpha_2)\]

        is given by \[x = A \cos (\omega t + \alpha)\] where \[A^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2 A_1 A_2 \cos (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1),\] \[A \sin \beta = A_2 \sin (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1),\] and \[\alpha = \alpha_1 + \beta.\]

  \item The combination in complex representation

        \[z_1 = A_1 e^{j (\omega t + \alpha_1)}\]
        \[z_2 = A_2 e^{j (\omega t + \alpha_2)}\]

        is given by

        \[z = e^{j (\omega t + \alpha_1)} [A_1 + A_2 e^{j (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1)}]\]

  \item In the case where $A_1 = A_2$ if we denote $\delta = \alpha_2 - \alpha_1$ then \[\beta = \frac{\delta}{2}\] and \[A = 2 A_1 \cos \beta = 2 A_1 \cos \frac{\delta}{2}\]

  \item The superposition of two sinusoids with different periods will itself be periodic if there exist integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ such that \[T = n_1 T_1 = n_2 T_2\] where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the periods of the two sinusoids

  \item Periodic motion in two or more dimensions can be represented by extending the ``projection of a rotating vector'' approach, with one vector for each axis, e.g. \[x = A_1 \cos \omega t\] \[y = A_2 \cos \omega t\] where differing amplitudes, frequencies, and phase differences product different curves called \textbf{Lissajous curves}
\end{itemize}

\section{The free vibrations of physical systems}

\begin{itemize}
  \item When a tensile force is applied to a material it elongates. The ratio of the elongation to the original length $x / l_0$ is known as the \textbf{tensile strain}

  \item The ratio of the tensile force to the cross sectional area of the material $F / A$ is known as the \textbf{tensile stress}

  \item The ratio of stress and strain is a constant known as \textbf{Young's modulus} $Y$

  \item The force exerted by the stretched material on another object is given by \[\frac{F / A}{x / l_0} = -Y \Rightarrow F = -\frac{A Y}{l_0} x\] which is in the form of Hooke's law with $k = -\frac{A Y}{l_0}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Forced vibrations and resonance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Periodic motion that isn't simple harmonic is \textbf{anharmonic}
\end{itemize}

\section{Coupled oscillators and normal modes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A property of a normal mode is that all objects oscillate at the same frequency
\end{itemize}

\section{Normal modes of continuous systems. Fourier analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item If a medium is vibrating at a natural frequency with only one end fixed (e.g. the pressure in a tube with one end open), the length of the medium must be an integer multiple of quarter wavelengths

\item In one-dimensional systems, the frequency of a normal mode $f_n$ is proportional to the mode number $n$ for small $n$

\item In higher-dimensional systems, the frequency of a normal mode $f_n$ is not proportional to the mode number $n$

\item In higher-dimensional systems, one frequency may correspond to multiple normal modes and is said to be \textbf{degenerate}

\item The process of determining the coefficients of a Fourier series is called \textbf{harmonic analysis}

\item One way to think of orthogonal functions is as vectors of infinite dimension. Two $n$-dimensional vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal if their scalar product is $0$, i.e. \[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0 \text{ if } \sum_0^n a_n b_n = 0.\] If two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are considered vectors of infinite dimension then the expression is similar \[\int_0^L f(x) g(x) \,dx = 0 \text{ is approximately } \sum_{n = 0}^\infty f(x_n) g(x_n) = 0\]
\end{itemize}

\section{Progressive waves}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A normal mode of vibration of a stretched string can be described as the superposition of two sine waves, identical to one another, traveling in opposite directions

        \begin{align*}
          y_n(x, t) & = A \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right) \cos \omega_n t                                                                                  \\
                    & = \frac{1}{2} A_n \left[ \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} - \omega_n t \right) + \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} + \omega_n t \right) \right]   \\
                    & = \frac{1}{2} A_n \left[ \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (x - v t) \right) + \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (x + v t) \right) \right]
        \end{align*}

  \item In reality the wave velocity $v$ is typically a function of the frequency $f$ / the wavelength $\lambda$

  \item When deriving the wave equation it's possible to deal only with first derivatives, i.e.

        \begin{align*}
          y(x, t)                       & = A \sin \left[ \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (x - v t) \right]                          \\
          \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} & = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} A \cos \left[ \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (x - v t) \right]    \\
          \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} & = -\frac{2 \pi v}{\lambda} A \cos \left[ \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} (x - v t) \right] \\
          \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} & = -\frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
        \end{align*}

        however this only applies to waves travelling in the positive $x$ direction. By taking the second derivative we arrive at a relation that also applies to waves travelling in he negative $x$ direction \[\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\]

  \item If a function $y(t)$ is even with respect to its midpoint in time, i.e. $y(-t) = +y(t)$, then it can be represented by a Fourier series of cosine functions alone. If it is odd, i.e. $y(-t) = -y(t)$ then it can be represented by sine functions alone. Otherwise its Fourier series contains both sine and cosine functions.

  \item In performing the frequency analysis of a short pulse of a particular frequency $f$, we find that the longer the pulse the better it is represented by a single sinusoidal wave of frequency $f$ â€” the width of its frequency spectrum narrows. Inversely, as the pulse shortens the width of its frequency spectrum broadens.

  \item \textbf{Cut-off} is the inability of a dispersive medium to transmit waves above (or possibly below) a certain critical frequency. The rate at which waves above the maximum frequency attenuate is proportional to the frequency.

  \item Energy per unit length is also known as energy density

  \item The kinetic energy per unit length of a sinusoidal wave on a stretched string given by $y(x, t) = f(x \pm vt) = f(z)$ is \[\frac{d K}{d x} = \frac{1}{2} \mu \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \mu v^2 [f'(z)]^2\] and the potential energy per unit length is \[\frac{d U}{d x} = \frac{1}{2} T \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} T [f'(z)]^2.\] Given that \[v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \Rightarrow \mu v^2 = T\] these values are equal.

  \item The total energy in a wavelength of a sinusoidal wave on a stretched string is given by \[E = \frac{1}{2} (\lambda \mu) \mu_0^2\] where \[\mu_0 = 2 \pi f A.\] This is also the amount of work that must be done on the string to establish that wavelength

  \item The rate at which work is done on a stretched string to establish a sinusoidal wave is \[P = \frac{1}{2} \mu \mu_0^2 v\] which is the amount of energy in the wave per unit length $\frac{1}{2} \mu \mu_0^2$ times the velocity at which the wave propagates $v$
\end{itemize}
